# Air Quality API Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Air Quality API, a project aimed at providing real-time air quality information for cities around the world and to be more specific about the nearest city of yours location and Berlin.
This API allows you to access air quality data for specific locations like Berlin Germany, monitor pollution levels, and integrate air quality information into your applications.
#### Technology Stack:

Node.js: Backend server
Strapi CMS: Data management
IQAIR API: Source of air quality data

## Install and Run the Code
1) npm install

2) npm run develop
   
3) To manage your project üöÄ, go to the administration panel at:
http://localhost:1337/admin

4) To access the server ‚ö°Ô∏è, go to:
http://localhost:1337

## Project Overview

The Air Quality API relies on the IQAIR platform to fetch air quality data for the Paris Zone, ensuring that you have the latest information.

### Key Features

Retrieve air quality data for the Paris Zone.
Schedule automated data updates using a CRON job every 1 minute.
Access the most polluted date and time in Berlin.

Now, let's explore how to use the API and leverage its capabilities.

#### Retrieve Air Quality Data for Paris

To access air quality data for the Paris Zone, use the following endpoint:

Endpoint: /paris

HTTP Method: GET

Description: This endpoint allows you to retrieve real-time air quality information for the Paris Zone. The response includes data such as city, state, country, timestamp, AQI (Air Quality Index) values, and more.

Request:
GET /paris


#### Retrieve Air Quality Data for nearest City

To access air quality data for the Nearest City, use the following endpoint:

Endpoint: /nearest-city

HTTP Method: GET

Description: This endpoint allows you to retrieve real-time air quality information for the nearest City.

Request:
GET /nearest-city

##### Schedule Automated Data Updates (CRON job)
To receive automated air quality data updates for the Paris Zone, a CRON job has been set up to fetch the latest information every minute. You can configure your system to consume this data periodically.


######  Access the Most Polluted Date and Time
To access the date and time when the Paris Zone experienced the highest pollution levels, use the following endpoint:

Endpoint: /most-polluted-datetime

HTTP Method: GET

Description: This endpoint provides you with the date and time of the most polluted conditions in the Paris Zone, based on historical data collected by the CRON job.

Request:
GET /most-polluted-datetime

### Purpose:

The Air Quality API serves as a valuable resource for developers, researchers, and organizations interested in accessing accurate and up-to-date air quality information for the city of Paris. It promotes informed decision-making and the development of applications that contribute to better air quality awareness.

Note: The project is developed with a strong commitment to quality and efficiency, with potential for further enhancements and integrations.
